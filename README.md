# SaveEyes
A simple notification tool to save your eyes from fatigue!

Although we know the importance of frequent breaks while working for long hours in-front of PC's, we tend to forget it while at work.This wpf application reminds us to take breaks with the help of timely, non-annoying notifications with a sound. After launching the application, click on the 'Lets Begin' button. This opens the configuation window to select the count-down interval for notification in minutes. Then click on Start button. You are good to go! You can see the time left for notification in the minimized configuration window.

According the popular 20-20-20 rule( https://opto.ca/health-library/the-20-20-20-rule ), it is recommended to give a break to the eyes from the screen every 20 minutes. Hence this is the default setting of the app. On directly clicking the start button, without entering any interval, it will kick off the application with 20 minute interval setting.

This is my first wpf app and hope it helps you to be healthy at work. Would love to hear your feedback.
